# PrototypAR

> A desktop AR system that allows children to create models of complex systems with craft paper and conduct experiments in the accompanied virtual simulation environment. 

## Key Features
- Computer vision based recognnition of paper models of compelx systems model (e.g., bike, camera, and aquarium)
- Assessment of the user model
- Provision of design feedback via AR visualizations
- Virtual simulation
